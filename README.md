# Disaster-Tweet-Classification-using-NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been widely used in various applications, including disaster management. This paper focuses on NLP-based disaster tweet classification using various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, BERT, LSTM, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. The proposed method aims to classify disaster-related tweets into different categories, such as infrastructure damage, human casualties, and other related aspects. The results show that BERT outperforms the other algorithms in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and precision. This project highlights the importance of NLP-based techniques in disaster management and provides insights into future enhancements.
